## Intro
The plan is a simple water tank thermostat that has a wifi interface to set/get the temperature
along with an mechanism to boost the temperature at times, in order to clear any Legionella.

## Features

 * 2 Thermocouples, one is used as a hardware based max temp override, the other is into the ADC for reading the temperature.
 * Both Main AC and 5/12V logic level input/output switching, so it can drive a conventioanl CH/HW system or a low voltage controller.
 * 12V DC input (via barrel jack).
